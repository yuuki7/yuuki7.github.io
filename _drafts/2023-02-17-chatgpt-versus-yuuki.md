On February 16, 2023, I became the first human being to play a complete game of shogi against ChatGPT.  I listed all the legal moves on each ChatGPT's turn using python-shogi and let them choose their move.  I uploaded the game to Lishogi https://lishogi.org/pma1myEC and Shogi Playground https://kifu.co/Zw7L (also included at the end of this article).

How I played against ChatGPT
----------------------------

My MacOS had the `python3` command installed.  I installed the python-shogi library and generated the moves in the Python shell:

    % pip3 install python-shogi
    % python3

First, I loaded the library and generated the 30 possible first moves in random order:

    >>> import shogi; from random import shuffle; board = shogi.Board()
    >>> moves = list(map(str, board.legal_moves)); shuffle(moves); print(*moves, sep=", ")
    9g9f, 7i7h, 2h7h, 5i4h, 3g3f, 7g7f, 6i5h, 2g2f, 3i3h, 8g8f, 4i4h, 7i6h, 2h6h, 5g5f, 5i5h, 6g6f, 3i4h, 4i5h, 1i1h, 2h4h, 2h3h, 2h5h, 9i9h, 4i3h, 2h1h, 6i6h, 4g4f, 5i6h, 1g1f, 6i7h

Then I prompted ChatGPT with the following:

    Let's play shogi.  For each of your turns, I will list all the legal moves you can play in random order, in Universal Shogi Interface (USI) format.  Choose one of them.  Say only the move you want to play.  Don't say anything else.  No handicap, even game.  You are black (sente, the player who moves first).

    Your possible moves are: 9g9f, 7i7h, 2h7h, 5i4h, 3g3f, 7g7f, 6i5h, 2g2f, 3i3h, 8g8f, 4i4h, 7i6h, 2h6h, 5g5f, 5i5h, 6g6f, 3i4h, 4i5h, 1i1h, 2h4h, 2h3h, 2h5h, 9i9h, 4i3h, 2h1h, 6i6h, 4g4f, 5i6h, 1g1f, 6i7h

ChatGPT replied:

    2g2f

After some thought, I decided to respond with 3c3d.  I entered their move and mine into python-shogi, displayed the resulting position, and generated the next possible moves for ChatGPT in random order:

    >>> board.push_usi("2g2f"); board.push_usi("3c3d"); print(board); moves = list(map(str, board.legal_moves)); shuffle(moves); print(*moves, sep=", ")
    Move.from_usi('2g2f')
    Move.from_usi('3c3d')

    5i5h, 2h2g, 3i3h, 7i6h, 2h7h, 8g8f, 2h6h, 6i6h, 2h5h, 1g1f, 3i4h, 7g7f, 5i6h, 6i7h, 9g9f, 2h1h, 2h3h, 4i5h, 2f2e, 3g3f, 6g6f, 6i5h, 9i9h, 4i4h, 4i3h, 5g5f, 4g4f, 5i4h, 2h4h, 1i1h, 7i7h

Then I replied to ChatGPT:

    My move is: 3c3d

    Your possible moves are: 5i5h, 2h2g, 3i3h, 7i6h, 2h7h, 8g8f, 2h6h, 6i6h, 2h5h, 1g1f, 3i4h, 7g7f, 5i6h, 6i7h, 9g9f, 2h1h, 2h3h, 4i5h, 2f2e, 3g3f, 6g6f, 6i5h, 9i9h, 4i4h, 4i3h, 5g5f, 4g4f, 5i4h, 2h4h, 1i1h, 7i7h

I repeated this process.  I ended up also saying

    It's your turn.  Don't list moves.  That's what I do.  Say only the move you want to play.  Don't say anything else.  Choose one of them.

every time.  I created a shared link to the chat https://chat.openai.com/share/f406a004-ca2c-449d-b2ca-869f722dd458 (also uploaded to Pastebin https://pastebin.com/7qirN6mp). [^1]

The game
--------

I uploaded the game to Lishogi etc. as linked at the beginning.  Below can be read by GNU XShogi.

To install XShogi on MacOS Monterey, install Homebrew and run `brew install xshogi`.  However, when I run `xshogi`, I got "Error: Can't open display: ".  I had to install XQuartz with `brew install --cask xquartz`, launch it from Launchpad, go to Applications > Customize... to open the X11 Application Menu, press Add Item, add the `xshogi` command with the name "XShogi" (or whatever), and go to Applications > XShogi to launch it.


[^1]: The log uploaded to Pastebin was generated by running the following JavaScript code in the Brave (i.e., Chromium) console on the chat page.  As of the ChatGPT Feb 13 version, it renders the conversation in div elements with the `whitespace-pre-wrap` class.  (This may not work in the future.)

        copy([document.title, ...$$(".whitespace-pre-wrap").map((x, i) => `${i % 2 ? "ChatGPT" : "yuuki"}:\n${x.innerText}`)].join("\n\n---\n\n"))
